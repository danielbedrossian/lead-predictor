This notebook explores the use of the Random Forest Classifier model within a sales team of a B2B SaaS company. Sales teams leverage huge amounts of data regarding current clients and prospective clients/leads, this notebook intends to leverage subsets of that data to make predictions on which leads/prospects would be most worthwhile to pursue. The practical application of this model would assist in lowering workloads of sales teams and thinning the collection of leads to focus on more attainable prospects.

Note: All datasets used in this notebook have been simulated. The primary goal of this notebook is to showcase a proof of concept for the model.
